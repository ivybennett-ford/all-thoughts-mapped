# What is wrong with designers?
A talk by [Ximena Vila Ferral](https://ximenavf.com/), a [[design|designer]] and developer, given at the 2020 RWC Symposium

### [[Empathy]]
- Empathy is a critical shortcoming for designers
- The relationship between developers and designers is fraught with small, but annoying, constraints
### Frustration
- Developers often aren't the ones sending designed layouts to the printers (or the digital push equivalent)
	- For developers, the design process often ends with the last pull request.
- Should designers [[code]]? Author says no, but they should understand how code works.
### Teamwork
- Empathy should be held 
- Designers and developers need an awareness of what causes frustration
- 'Our work is not us': this follows the dialogue of the 'ego-death'
	- Design is there to solve a problem, not create them.
	- A design might *look* really good, but if it doesn't solve a problem, then it's just art
