### The cosmopolitan ethic
- Academy in the West, in the Global north, part of the [[one-third-world]], early on made some very grave and racist mistakes about the pre-conditions for [[knowledge]]. These mistakes led to the creation of fields like [[anthropology]]. 
		- Is Harvey claiming that [[geographt]], beyond physical location, has some influence over *the capability* to generate knowledge? Because that's sure as shit what Kant thought, and that would be wrong. Geographt might affect *what* you know, but certainly not *how you know it*.
- Kant called this ability to know about one's ["thematic universe"](pedagogy-of-the-oppressed.md), and henceforth *influence* it in the physical 'the cosmopolitan ethic.
