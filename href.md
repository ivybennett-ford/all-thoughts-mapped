Here's a quick walk-through on how to insert an `href`:

```html
<p>Your link appears <a href="another.html">here</a> inline </p>
```

What that looks like once it's rendered:
><p>Your link appears <a href="another.html">here</a> inline </p>

Obsidian lets you put raw `html` inline with your other words, I think because it's all just markdown anyway.
