### What is statisticsl bias?
Statistical bias refers to misaprehensions, and misreportage. Identifiying bias means harm-reduction.

[[Biases]] come in many shapes and sizes, and are informed by aspects of our identity and experience. The [[matrix-of-domination]] is a helpful [[story-telling|narrative]] we can use to measure the magnitude of bias. 

When we talk about statistical bias, we refer to the misapprehension of a statistic, of a measurement which fails to report meaningful information. It is this failure which represents such disasterous consequences in a data-science endeavor. 

>Statistical bias implies data reportage which belies fact. It can arise from a faulty ground-truth--when data scientists assume a prior which may be incongruous with historical evidence. It may manifest as a value which manfest like a flase negative rate in the lead question -- the presence of lead is incorrectly predicted based on statistics previously fed to the model.
