Key research question - how do we witness one another? What does it mean to be witnessed?

### The Observer
**The state**
	- Utilitarianism; John Stuart Mill
	- The Panopticon
	- The nausea of self-awareness; Jean-Paul Sartre, Nausea (1938), Hegel?
	
**The morning**
	- When the day begins, who is nearby to hear the birds singing? what witnesses are there to see the sun replace one band with another?
