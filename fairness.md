From Oxford's dictionary of languages, the impartial and just treatment or behavior without favoritism or discrimination. Further, the quality of having light-colored hair or pale complexion. 

The goal of [[equity|equitable]] behavior should ultimately be to repair a history of unfair, disparate treatment. Here, we are using disparate treatment and not disparate impact. Post-Reconstruction America saw the rights made law by amendments 13-15 deliberately and systematically obliterated by what would come to be known as Jim Crow laws. After generations of inhuman conditioning -- in some cases actual torture -- it is unreasonable to pretend that anything less than preferred status is acceptable. To do otherwise, to deny a transferral of [[power]] and agency would be a mere show of false generosity. The goal should be to acknowledge at every opportunity the existing agency of the underserved. 

~~Failure to do this would be a As Paolo Friere says in [[pedagogy-of-the-oppressed]], failure to reinforce or  the power of the historically underserved

- It is possible that revealing this information fails the community in terms of differential privacy


## The economy of fairness

[Closer??]

Lead-harboring water lines pose a deadly threat to all consumers. But history paints a picture of pernicious, exhaustive, and disproportionately ill-effects manifest in the dwellings and working spaces of Black, brown, and Indigenous community members. It should be well within the purview of a machine learning company to seek fair and equitable outcomes with the technology to hand. 

Since [I think 2016/2015, but let me fact-check w/ the profs], when the Flint water crisis grew to screaming pitch, and the reality of contaminated water could no longer be ignored by official channels, [profs + UMich team + others] have worked on a machine learning (ML) model to predict the location inventory lead service lines within community water systems. This product, which began as an academic effort, has now come to serve 15 municipalities, although that number seems to grow with each week. As recent national developments draw attention to this issue, it might occur to the reader to wonder how lead could have leached into the water system in the first place. Upon learning that it has officially been illegal to provide maintenance for public water systems using lead since the 1980s, you might further wonder how lead could possibly have been cleared for use in all this time, when the dangers of lead poisoning, and its after-effects have been well-documented for the last 90 years. You might then wonder, given that lead has been known to be toxic and was still used in homes and businesses, that it has been illegal to use lead, but not illegal for it to remain, for so very long, how the harm could even begin to be undone. This is where BlueConduit steps in.

There is a critical need to remove lead from the ground as quickly as possible. The longer lead from public water system (PWS) pipes remains in use, the more a community member is exposed, the more likely they may become seriously ill. And while there are EPA-approved acceptable lead levels, no amount of lead within a water system, or within the paint, or household appliance, is truly safe. If you are alarmed as you read this, then good. This is alarming, and nothing has been done about it for far too long.

The Flint water crisis was caused by a fluctuating and contaminated water system drawing lead from the inner walls of service lines into the drinking water of public dwellings. Since the outbreak of the crisis, up-to-date service line inventories have become mandatory to conduct and maintain. However! Municipalities only have so great a budget. The inventory is composed of several steps, which I will now elucidate:

 First, a city must decide if they plan to allocate funds for a excavation and replacement, HVAC, or a combination of both. They may outsource these tasks to engineering firms, who may well have the equipment, but are not always affordable without federal munificence. 

This allotment can be renewed from grants or loans made available upon petition. The next step becomes an application process. Some grant applicants are better-equipped to complete the process than others. I will address these issues in a moment. 

The city must first decide what they can apply for, then what they can afford. This is a challenging process in and of itself. Up until November 15 of this year, the amount of money hypothetically available specifically for inventories was limited, and difficult to obtain. Many cities simply could not afford to perform inventories at all. In practice, this is a time-bomb.

In a high-stakes decision, when thousands of dollars can either pull lead from the ground or sink a budget for a year or more, it is helpful to reveal as much information ahead of time as possible. If a city already knew where the lead was, then bob’s your uncle, applicant need only complete steps two and three as needed. 

But this can be a complex task. In a PWS, a service line consists of two components, the public side, and private side. There are two sections of pipe of a hitherto unknown material. Between the two pipes, [insert info about SL material + material uncertainty – use statistics if you like! – 11/19]

Social and environmental systems within the United States have long histories of directly and indirectly dealing harm to disenfranchised community members under the guise of purported inadequacy, or resource-scarcity.

  
  

The need for a complete service line inventory has become increasingly urgent in recent months. In June of this year, the Environmental Protection Agency published revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule, which detailed what lead levels are permissible in service lines,

On November 15, 2021, President Biden approved the most expansive infrastructure bill ever to be made law in United States’ history. [Needs citation]. The need for accurate service line inventories has grown ever more urgent in recent memory.
