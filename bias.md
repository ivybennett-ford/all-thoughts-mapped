From Mitchell (1980):
>"...\[Bias refers to] to any basis for choosing one generalization over another, other than strict consistency with the observed training instances.

Bias is the tendency to make choices aligned with individual preference. The [[matrix-of-domination]] is a framework under which priveleges are assessed dimensionally; a very little bias is expected, informed by experience and identity. But bias becomes a problem when the consequence of a high-stakes decision affects a group or individual disparately. When an [[actor]] or actor-network becomes aware of their preexisting biases, work can be done to undo or prevent harm.
