Literally, [[data]] is [[hand-coded]] when it is [[classification|classified]] by an individual, or individuals.

It is the mandate of ethical [[data-science]] that hand-coding data is conducted with a guiding set of mutually-agreed upon principles. It is often the failure of western global north thinkers that decisions are made by the [[individual]], and not by the [[collective]]. And while an individual may be an ethically and morally reasonable person, it is incorrect to assume that ethical or morally correct decisions can be made in a [[vacuum]].
