#### Professional Development with Ian and Sheela
 - Areas
	 - Confidence ??? (you see what I mean?)
	 - New technology: learning to work with clients/fulfillment
	 - Leadership
 - Goal for 6-12 months from now
	 - Have successfully facillitated a knowledge transfer between external partnerships and the working group to research and development. I want to have identified a client-community-sanctioned product idea and have prototyped it, within a year.
	 - Alternatively, I want to have established a regular forum space between client governments and the communities they serve
 - 3 activities to futher the goal
	 - Extend the working group format to liasing with external partners
	 - Increased frequency or duration of meeting
	 - Have worked directly with a client (as a shadow or first person), to get a sense of the questions they have beyond lead lines. This would be an ongoing activity, which would expose me to:
		 - Working in a client-centered timeline
		 - Working with the Data Team
		 - Enhancing my communication skills through task-oriented dialogue

- Black and Veach style townhalls do happen -- Nya/RG/AR/DG...literally everyone
- Cadence within the product team
	- Current customer? Take prototype suggestions
		- Talk through as a team
		- Time on AR/RG calendars
- Sydney - Learning a new skill, honing existing skills
- Ashley R. - Becoming *the* PM, expanding a PM network, triangulating between a customer/community-informed 


AR Notes
- Who would champion this effort? Would you be in charge?
	- Ideally a collective thing
- Higher product and
