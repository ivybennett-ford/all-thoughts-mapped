In this video essay [Princess Weekes](https://www.youtube.com/c/MelinaPendulum) discusses her position on progressive reboots of television shows, and injected wokeness. She talks about reboots like Gossip Girl, Charmed, and the new Sex and the City. She holds that while the retrofitting might have have been well-intentioned, there remains ground to cover. In some cases the [[story-telling]] feels forced or tone-deaf, as in the case of Gossip Girl and Sex and the City. In the case of Charmed, the studio seems to have hired three Latine people to play the sisters, and then done nothing more to further the dialogue. Therefore, instead of drawing in a new audience, or speaking to long-time fans with a history of under- or misrepresentation, the productions lose artistic [[value]]. As Weekes says, the companies convey:

>"[A] failure to communicate the intent of this work with the audience they are trying to represent, allegedly"


>"It's not enough that you want to tell progressive stories. You also need to understand what you're trying to subvert: the history of representational pain on the screen that you are trying not to repeat."
