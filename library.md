### What is a library?
A library is collection of artifacts organized around a predetermined set of guidelines or themes. In short, a library is a [[relational-database]], where the relation is defined by the [[designer]].

If the artifacts are physical, like a book or a piece of art, then the catalogue may include meta aspects: an author's name, when and where the piece was produced.

Artifacts might not be so corporeal. Some libraries might only exist in ideas, organized around an imperative: to document, to describe.

[[the-brain|Brains]] are not libraries. Although information may be accessed based on [[recall]] with varying degrees of [[precession]] or [[accuracy]], the brain is not a 'perfect' system.
