# Tarot
Reading tarot is a [[ritual|ritual]] act to portend the future. Realistically, it occurs when one person cold-reads another: a fate is revealed with pictures on a set of cards, the fate is informed by myriad little observations the cold-reader makes. A cold-reader is someone who can make speedy inferences about a person based on what they say and do, how they dress, how they hold themselves. 

Reading tarot is a useful skill. While tarot is certainly not the only system for telling the future, the [[arcana]] are well-known to many. Empirically, we can safely assume that there is less that is mystical in the world than some would have us believe. But there remains this doubt. We undergo some pretty serious conditioning as we grow up. Education in America is firmly within the bounds of [[white-supremacy|white-supremacy]]: that is, a school system that teaches convenient truths, or outright lies about the history of Western cultures, leaving history from east of the Prime Meridian to later courses, different courses. Paulo Friere calls this the 'banking pedagogy,' where [[knowledge]] is deposited into students' minds without care or intention.
