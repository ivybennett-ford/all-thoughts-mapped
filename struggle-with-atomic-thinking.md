It is hard to hold a thought in your head as a single entitiy. [[note|note]]-taking in obsidian has felt liberating, compared to other methods. Yet I struggle with beginning and finishing [[atomicity|atomic]] notes. My outlines bristle with [[connectivity|connections]], but I seem to struggle with migrating them beyond this phase. A topic appears in my head and then I am gone, off in another direction. This might have a lot to do with [[neurodivergence]], and my [[ADHD]]. The [[time|time-scale]] is all wrong for how long it takes to complete something. It feels wrong, or perhaps just hard, to [[measure-for-management]].
