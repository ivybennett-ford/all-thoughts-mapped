From stories, ghosts are the nebulous product of superstition and the strong emotional reaction to [[death]]. We expect there to exist a certain temporal displacement between the living and the dead. The precise quantity of [[time]] is not perscribed, and in my article [[the-upper-middle-class-is-full-of-ghosts]], I will analyze how it is possible to become a ghost even before death.

In her book [[darkly]], Leila Taylor reminds us that ghosts are the lingering [[trauma]] of [[life]], as it was lived, as the lived experience imprinted itself into its surroundings.

In fact, of all the emotions we feel about people who have died, regret, guilt, and shame probably rank among the most commonly felt.

Ghosts are closely associated with the concept of souls, and an after-life state of existence. In theory, a person is born with a soul, and when their physical body dies, their soul becomes detached. The question of what happens after a person dies is *widely* debated. For example, if souls are real, what are they composed of? How does their existence impact the physical world? What does it mean to be truly *alive* or truly *dead*?

This last question is of particular interest from a [[marxism|marxist]] perspective. i must admit that this line of questioning feels supremely *Western.* In their article [[the-time-of-history-and-the-times-of-gods]], Dipesh Chakrabarty makes the case that [...]
