# The Bremen-town Musicians: A retelling
Once upon a time an old Donkey lived with a miller. Every day the miller would hitch the donkey to the grindstone and in circles he would walk *all day long.* 
~~Although~~ The donkey had little time to enjoy the sunshine outside the millhouse, ~~or any sound but the rumbling tumbling whoosh of water, stone, and grain,~~but he was not discontented. You see, in his youth, the Donkey had learned to harmonize with the rumbling tumbling whoosh of water, stone, and grain, and while he worked, he would sing tunes of his own conception.

One day began differently. The tithes that year had been steep indeed, and the miller found need to increase profit margins or everyone under his roof would be out of soup and bread come winter. In his heart, he knew that the only logical conclusion would mean the purchase of a new, younger donkey, who would not tire as quickly, or eat quite so much. Arrangements we made.

Our Donkey may have sung all day if he wished, but not so loudly he could not hear the plot sprung.
