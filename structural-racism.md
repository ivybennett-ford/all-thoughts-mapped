Structural racism is the marginalization of Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and other persons of color on the basis of skin color or racial identity. It presents as an 'invisible force,' or difficult-to-identify decision-maker, whose key performance indicator is the reenforcement of white supremacy.

Efforts to combat this include measuring how [[fair]] or unfair a system of interest is. This can be accomplished in several ways: by asking questions, by [[model|modeling]] a system and generating [[fairness-metrics]], and by making connections between people across many places within the community to transfer a shared sense of responsibility. 

You'd also want to combat this by bringing in some serious Marxist dialectical discussion.
