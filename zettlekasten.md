## The Well-Fed Zettlekasten
A zettlekasten is a [[knowledge]] management system (KMS). The concept was not new when Niklas Luhmann adopted the [[slip-card]] system during the 20th century.

A *zettle* is a [[note|note]]. Good zettles should be [[atomicity|atomic]], and the zettlekasten should have the property of [[connectivity]]

>**Is your Zettelkasten designed for a single writing project or topic, or do you want to map all you know with this tool?**
