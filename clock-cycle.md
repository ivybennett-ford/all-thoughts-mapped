Processes are measured on [[time]] scales. In electronics, this is done by calibrating an internal clock source. Using the countable nature of time, we can design and measure robust systems for accuracy. 

### Internal clocks

### Logic and the gate array

### Systems on ASIC

### Time to frequency domain conversion

### Specific use-case
- The [[lock-in-amplifier]]
