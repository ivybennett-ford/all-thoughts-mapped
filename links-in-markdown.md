For external links, the following is required:
```
https:// or http://www.youraddresshere.domain
```
Otherwise, the path interpreter will assume you meant a filepath, and will automatically make you a filepath matching your intended web address.


For `.md` documents:
```
[Name of link](prefixed link address)
```

You can totally assign internal links with relative paths, as demonstrated in [[regression-analysis]] and the location of `plant_growth.png`.
