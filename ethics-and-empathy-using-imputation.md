### What is imputation?
### How can it be approached with ethics and empathy?
### Workbench section
- Disaggregation will undo harm done to communities of color, made all the more apparent by the COVID-19 pandemic
- This work centers empathy at the core of data science. 
- Information on race and ethnic differences is often delinked from the conversations in which is most prevalent. 
	- Failure to link this information ethically perpetuates structures of cisheteropatriarchy and white supremacy.

- "To avoid generating statistically biased estimates that can produce invalid, inaccurate results, researchers can use different approaches to solve for missing data by either removing the date completely under certain conditions or using imputation as a way to solve for missing data by either removing the data completely under certain conditions or using imputation as a way to develop reasonable proximates to fill in information for the missing data (Donders et al. 2006)."(p.2)
