Personally, observation and description can be made about anything.

In Anne Carson's [[the-autobiography-of-red]], description becomes likeness, and not dissimilarity. Tango is only for those who have come before, the same 5 or 6.

Little fountains rise in our minds and become something remarkable. This is true for anyone, no mater who they are.

[[here's-a-thought]]: anything might be worth the [[time]] it takes to write down. Even if you eyes fall from the page. 

It is perhaps the case that this meta-map of all possible things I find interesting will not be helpful in the long run. But it is the case that the heirarchic structure of a file system is ragging me. It get's me down.
