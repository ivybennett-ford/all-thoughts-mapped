Hiring practices might become more inclusive and equitable on paper. The interview process might check all a candidate's boxes. Yet a huge gap in retention remains for Black academics and professionals in companies operated under traditional [[neoliberal-efficiency-model|neoliberal-efficiency-models]].

Explicit culture shifts need to occur to ensure long-term change. The goodwill and open-eared listening cannot stop after the interview meeting tab is closed on a candidate's computer. Successful antiracist collectivism means less work for our already tired Black coworks.

In a [blog post](https://blackgirldoesgradschool.com/2021/01/30/taxing-labor-energizing-work/) published in January 2021, Dr. Ravynn K. Stringfield says that insisting on the prioritization of inscribed heirarchy under racist systems cheats institutions of transformation. She describes the state of emotional duress each and every 'meeting' brings her. 

I am not Dr. Stringfield's student or colleague. But to imagine her experience transposed to one of my own co-knowledge-workers or friends is frustrating beyond belief.

White supremacy has, for the most part, successfully segregated the academy and professional spaces along color lines. That little contact -- real fellowship, where oppressive structures are undone -- means that meetings are (an exhuasting) likely necessary first step. But gee, it would be great if white knowledge workers would start being antiracist faster and reify spaces more accessible to their Black and contingent co-staff.
