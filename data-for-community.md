Thesis: the neoliberal efficiency model fails to address critical tradeoffs in privacy, and does not even without inset kinds of [[bias]] and discrimination.

  

(reminiscent of the attention economy — answer to this in _My Year of Rest and Relaxation_?)

  

Imagine the dialogue in a play. Two actors appear on stage discussing the weather. Off-stage a roll of thunder is let fly. The characters argue: should they make for cover, or prolong their walk along the grassy scenery? Between delivered lines, menacing hints of the oncoming storm sound in the wings. The stage lights soften and dim with a bruise-purple filter. Clearly, a storm is on the way. The characters remain in the field. 

  

“I would like to have my tea here, in the grass,” says one.

  

“But clearly a storm is rolling in, we must adjourn,” says the other. They remain in the field, passing protestations back and forth. For all the second’s proclivities, their predicament does not appear to change. Fat water drops land at their feet, just before the lower stage lights. 

  

With a final boiling vocalization from the thunder sheet, a flash of stage lightning, the rain-maker opens upon the foolhardy speakers. They are soaked, and tea-less; they hasten for the nearest boom-light, and the scene closes. 

  

Undoubtedly, an audience member watching such a scene might find themselves internally urging the characters _off the stage_, clearly a storm approaches.
