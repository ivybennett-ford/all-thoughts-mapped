[[graph]]
[[graph-theory]]
- Location doesn't matter at all
- The 'links' between [[nodes]]/[[note|notes]] are called [[edges]]
	- Graph theory tells us edges have direction
	- Nodes and edges are labesls
	- Edges will usually share a label
	- A path is defined as the starting node, the edge, and the terminal node --> the path creates a statement
	- Relationships can be modeled with this statements
	- Metadata leads to more nodes and new relationships
