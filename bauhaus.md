A German [[design|design]] [[art]] pedagogy popular during the early twentieth century. The practice embodied *Gesamtkunstwerk*, where the artist induces form and function in a 'total artwork.'

The methodology forces the viewer to challenge their internal conception of art and use. The [[bauhaus|Bauhaus]] designer must then also be intentional. They must decide to what extent form intervenes on behalf of function and vice versa.

The design school focused on the intersection between [[craft]] and art. Students worked in such disciplines as [[print-making]], [[weaving]], [[architecture]], [[typography]], and [[furniture-making]].
