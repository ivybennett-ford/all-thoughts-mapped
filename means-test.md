According to wikipedia, a means test is a determination of whether an individual or family is eligible for government assistance or welfare, based upon whether the individual or family posses the means to do without that help. 

The Canada Health Act and the National Unemployed Workers' Movement in Canada and the UK respectively implemented means testing often to the detriment of the intended beneficiaries. In the UK at least, an individual or family's access to capital is assessed and by that ratio, their needs are determined for elligibility of aid. Per English Poor Laws, claimants to aid are required to be destitute, without specific instruction on how this was precisely determined. 

In the United States, means testing is applied accross the board for all our old favorites -- Section 8, SNAP, Pell Grants, TANF, Medicaid, FWS, and SEOG, and those debtors who have the means to pay some of the principle. Means testing is also used in the US to determine Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

Out of context, one employs a means test to determine if the object can perform. Since starting this article, it has since been determined that BlueConduit's [[debiasing]] module should be turned off for all tennants until otherwise indicated, regardless of data aggregation status. This is because it is currently unclear whether the debiasing module is truly performant or [[fairness|fair]].
