A [[note]] is a thought or idea about a concept. In the framework of personal [[knowledge]] management, a note is treated as a foundational node.

From [[functional-programming]], we are charged to treat [[code]] as [[data]], and the same can be said of notes.

Notes and associated metadata, are used to reveal known and yet-to-be-discovered connections between ideas. The trope goes that data becomes [[information]], becomes knowledge, becomes [[wisdom]].

According to some easily-searchable sources on [[digital-garden]]s, atomicity is key.
