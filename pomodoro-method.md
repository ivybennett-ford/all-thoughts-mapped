The process of breaking a work-day up into increments separated by timed breaks. After four or five increments, a longer break is inserted. Unwittingly, I have been using this method for quite some time. 45 minutes seems to be about the right duration for me before I succumb to unproductive distraction. Well might you wonder what things like '[[productivity]]' and '[[distraction]]' really mean. But my relationship with [[time]] is a contentious one. There never seems to be exactly enough of it, always too little or too much. Using a timer to work has legitimzed this in ways I could not have predicted. 

Francesco Cirillo developed the technique during his time as a university student in the 1980s, and since then, the method has become popular among educators. The initial method called for shorter, 20-30 minute blocks. To begin, decide on a task that must be completed. Should you finish the task in less time than the alotted block, use the remainder to review, improve, or make notes on the tasks completed. The method recommends you work on one thing at a time. This, however, is quite difficult for me -- unless I am in a meeting, unless I have already found a flow state that has overcome my [[ADHD]] symptoms.
