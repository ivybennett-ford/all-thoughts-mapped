### so you want to write a blog
- What kinds of content do you expect to create?
- Where will this blog live?
- How often will you publish?
- Does any of the above *really* matter?
- Where will you share this information?
- What happens when you are wrong? 
	- How will you accept feedback?
	- How available will you make yourself, i.e., will you share other places to find you, or will this be **secret**?
