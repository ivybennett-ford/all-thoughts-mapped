An algorithm is a representation of a system through procedural or mathematical steps. 

The person developing an algorithm might decide that the math (or script, or proof) has reached a stage of sufficient maturity, and can not be used in situ. At this point, one might call this a [[model]] or [[estimator]].

In this context, we are using an algorithm to fuel a machine learning model, or support an ML pipeline.

This is a nebulous linguistic distinction. The word2vec distance between algorithm and estimator, or model, is yet to be determined by this writer. However, it is important to keep in mind that the words are nearly interchangeable in my work.

Algorithms are usually written to take a measurement, perhaps over and over again. If the algorithm describes a system, the returned results are system [[states]], where there exists meanful state-space data.
