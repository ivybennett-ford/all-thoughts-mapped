This is a term I have made up to describe layers of increasing [[power]], i.e., placement within the [[matrix-of-domination]]. It is an imperfect metaphor, and I will try to fix it as soon as possible. 

I initially called them 'power-shadows,' but this has a single-axis bent which disagrees with the whole notion of an power matrix anyway.
