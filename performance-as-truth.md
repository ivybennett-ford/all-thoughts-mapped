From the epigraph of 'Goth-ish' in Leila Taylor's [[darkly]]:
>"Goths regeject the bourgeois sense of human identity as a serious business, stable, abiding, and continuous, requiring the assertion of one true cohesive inner self as proof of health and good citizenry. Instead goths celebrate human identity as devised by stylized acts. They like carefully staged extremism, and vicarious or strictly ritualized experiences of the dreadful Other."
>Richard Davenport-Hines, *Gothic: Four Hundred Years of Excess, Horror, Evil and Ruin*

>"If the funny T-Shirt slogans and crisp khaki pants of the average American tell the lie that everything is going to be OK, the black lace garbs and ghoulish capes of goth tell the truth -- that you suffer, then you die."
>Sarah Vowel, "American Goth," *This American Life*
