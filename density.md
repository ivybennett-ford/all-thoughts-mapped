Density is ratio of [[mass]] to [[volume]], or quantity to allocation. This is an incredibly useful [[metric]] to keep in mind. 

>$\rho = m / V$

Density is directly proportional to [[pressure]]. Although density is a fundamental property of a [[material]], it will affect the way the material behaves at different pressures, in different atmospheres.

Density is also a measure of [[connectivity]]. We can do this by measuring the number of [[edges]] or links between [[nodes-antinodes|nodes]]
