## A reflection of the mind's geography


Notes can be left in many different ways -- they may reflect every possible thought to be had in a day. These are called *fleeting notes*. Were you to carry a notebook in your pocket, and an idea occurred to you, you might want to pin it down with glue and a straightpin. This is the entymological shadow-box of your head.


Or, notes can be more structured. They may take up a life of their own, adopt scaffolding and scale mountains ovverlooking dense forests. 

For example:
- The thought
		- The linking idea -- [[here's-a-thought]]
		- This is an example of backlinking, a technique by which one node (or thought or whatever) references another within a framework.
				- In this case, the paradigm is the train of thought, but this can be more rigorously defined.
	- The contemplation
	- A sea of tranquility
	- New work

Maps can be very useful. Star charts, topographical surveys, a drawing of the trip from a house to the corner store, each serves (and reveals) a purpose.
