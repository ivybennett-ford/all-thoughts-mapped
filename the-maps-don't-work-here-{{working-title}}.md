Another to the most embarrassing encounter you’ve ever had in your lifetime. A disco-ball hung from the ceiling reflects lovely shafts of light. Rainbow lamps dart over a white board covered in differential equations — your homework for the day. A fog machine is busy pumping out blueberry scented mist. I

n your left ear, a conversation is carried out on the merits of one Minecraft mod over another. In your right, the strains of Total Eclipse of the Heart filter through the din. This is an attempt at describing what it’s like in my head at peak functioning. None of the sounds are real, only the images. They crowd and jostle one another.

Neatness has never really been my within my skill set. In fact, it was not until quite recently that I took an interest in keeping up the material aspects of my life at all. The same could be said of my internal, mental geography as well. If I handed a sub-mentus explorer, shrunk to the size of an electron, a map of my head and told them to navigate my [[the-brain|brain]] by following the signals across axons from one end to the other, you wouldn’t see them for the next three years. They might be able to send you a postcard from the custard-Rayleigh-Jeans-Frasier nexus. Lewis and Clarke could never. I am lucky if a single task is completed in a day, luckier still if the task was planned beforehand, and not enacted spontaneously. Speaking of, have you ever tried to spell spontaneous? I was bored by the first n.

There are a couple of possible diagnoses that I have been researched. [[ADHD]] or (ADHD), was once described in a twitter thread [link here?? Where??] as a strata of desire — where tasks or goals are accomplished by a percent likelihood the tasked _wanted_ to complete the object in the first place. This is not a fair characterization. It is far too simplistic to claim that a task will be accomplished because you wanted it done. Need, or urgency, can implicate action on conscious or unconscious levels [define here::check check check]. It is perhaps unfair even to distinguish awareness by ‘levels,’ when it is clear that decisions are not made in a vacuum. It is far too simplistic to characterize the interest-disinterest paradigm as a probability. Should a more robust classification be constructed, it must account for myriad complexities.

For a start, compulsion, that unreliable cocktail of urge and motivation, often takes over. You might find yourself _compelled_ to watch every single video on urban ranching ever created by a particular farmer, or arrange your kitchen knives the same way after every use. Compulsions affect each of us in different ways. The things we feel we _have_ to do — to make life easier, to accomplish a larger goal, to avoid pain — depend on foresight and the feedback of previous rewards. Metabolic variables need not affect the outcome of task-completion. How we sleep, what we eat, how dehydrated we become, can all affect our ability to maintain function within normal parameters. But I might be having the most hydrated day of my life and still find myself slip into a two-hour long raid through MELPA looking for hot new reading-list management packages for my doom configuration.

If my ability to focus, be productive, and complete tasks is not so closely linked to metabolic fluctuation, perhaps is stems from a history of trauma. I am a white, Latinx person. I am employed part-time, have attended some college, and live in the United States. These aspects of my identity shield me from an incomprehensible history of perpetrated wrongs and injustices against protected groups.

And of all possible shard human experiences, grief is probably the bitterest, and most dividing. It reshapes worldviews and impinges on relationships. It parameterizes bodies and subsequent experiences; a pair of parentheses aureoling every decision. It is a guest that leaves in its own time and no sooner. When I was ten, grief touched my family; in some ways, it was the worst possible thing that could have happened at the time. The causes of grief usual are. But time has eroded the sharp edges of fracture. People have moved and behaviors have altered. I am left with memory-shadows.

Contusion. Daffodil blooms under green under rusted purple. Memories become myth become dogma — a reason for action. 

 I need things to be a certain way. Some sounds just RUB ME THE WRONG WAY and I can’t stand even writing about them I do not want to think about them I do not at all, this was a terrible idea.

It’s funny. Even as I write this article on my experience with a neuro-divergent brain, I find myself slipping away into other thoughts. It is entirely possible that this piece, about which I felt so strongly not twenty minutes ago, will never see the world beyond the confines of this raw text file. Such is the little ego-death of written pursuits.

  

This is by no means meant as a love-letter to my brain. Think of this more as a defenestration. This cursed mass of grey matter refuses to let me focus. Memories and tastes force themselves to the surface at the slightest provocation, and I am left numbed, or raw, or amused, and sometimes, a hideous combination of many different feelings at once. It is noisy in here. It is often painful. It is joyful, and cramped, and feels like a clearance warehouse on a hot summer day just before a fabulous lightning storm. The air in here is charged. When I am at peace, it smells of orange blossoms and river water.
