Starting this note later in the day, but a couple of things have come up I want to write down before I forget. This could probably count as weekend work.

- [x] Note on [[iframes]]
- [x] Adjust code themes in obsidian>>can I change the color of file extentions/tags in graph view
	- TODAY I LEARNED ABOUT [[obsidian-groups]]!!!
	- generate a CSS snippet to hot-load group themes when you need them
		- I think the snippets are perma-loaded? >> check
- [ ] reseach another [[fairness|fairness]] algorithm
- [ ] read through porject log for [arzg's Make A Language](https://arzg.github.io/lang/)
- [x] finish up [[javascript-homework]] project
- [x] practice some language
- [ ] continue fleshing out digital garden notes

When you make new notes, try to init them from the kanban board, so you don't forget to schedule work around them
