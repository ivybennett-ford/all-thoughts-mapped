Today I plan to read another chapter of [[team-of-rivals]]. The reading so far has felt a little sluggish? DKG doesn't have the same kind of power behind her narrative voice as IW.

Need to:
	- Start tracking reading from [[warmth-of-other-suns]]
	- ~~Ping DG regarding [[equity]] publication~~
	- Consider taking a walk!
	- Draft a [[personal-statement]]

Want to add some things to my [[reading-list-management]]:
	- [[golden-gulag]] by Ruth Wilson Gilmore
