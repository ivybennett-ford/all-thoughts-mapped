I think a lot of the [[time]], I'm worried that whatever I set out to do just won't make me feel accomplished. A sense of accomplishment is evidently super important to me. And on top of that, I don't really set myself up with a good [[design]] for success. For example, my [[Create-Schedule Kanban]] is super full of really cool ideas. But I peck out progress on each of those things, rarely finishing. It's because I am unhappy with my ability to get things done.
