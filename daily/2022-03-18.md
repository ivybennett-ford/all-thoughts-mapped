- [ ] read some chapters in [[warmth-of-other-suns]] and [[team-of-rivals]]
- [ ] working on article about [[regression-analysis]]
- [ ] consider starting notes on [[logarithmic-regression]] and its application to sky plots
- [ ] [[coffee-shop-market-research]], and specifically looking into the resource partner network


Today felt disconnected. Last nigth lying in bed, had the most disturbing sensation of feeling the passage of years through the lens of someone else's project. Three years feels like so short a time when I think about it. But how can this be? Years once felt so long, and perhaps they are. Feeling confused, as though I am walking through pea soup.
