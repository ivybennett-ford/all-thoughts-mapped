Yay logging daily notes into daily worked! This was easy, but this is how I did it:

- Go to settings (`cmd+,`)
- Go to community plugins, under Daily Notes (this is enables along with the Calendar Plugin, so you can just click on days and it will take you to the daily note)
- Define file path to Daily folder in the assignment field
