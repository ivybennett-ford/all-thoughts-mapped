A pressurized vessel used to travel or explore bodies of water. Fabled in [[song]] and [[story-telling|story]].

For example, the submarine features largely in the animated film [[the-yellow-submarine]] from The Beatles. Before this, it was an amazing craft in Jules Verne's novel *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*.
