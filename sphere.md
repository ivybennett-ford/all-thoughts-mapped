alias: sphere, spherical
---
A three-[[dimensional]] object where every extremity is equidistant from the [[origin]].

A sphere may also serve as the basis for a [[coordinate-system]], or spherical coordinates. They contain three components: $\rho$, the radial, $\theta$, the polar angle measured from the zenith, and $\phi$, the azimuthal angle taken from the orthogonal projection onto a refernce plane which passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith.

The above definition is the ISO convention, however some math texts switch the symbology of $\theta$ and $\phi$.

This coordinate system is helpful in a lot of contexts, but especially so when doing anything with [[telescopes]] and [[astronomy|astrophysics]], or antenna design.
