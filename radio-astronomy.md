### Some perspective on length and speed
- [[Radio]] waves: 1m - 10,000km wavelength
- Microwaves: 1mm - 1m wavelength
- Infrared waves: 700nm - 1mm wavelength
- Optical spectrum: ~400nm - 700nm
- Ultraviolet waves: 10nm - 400nm
- X-rays: 1$\mu$m - 10nm
- Gamma rays: sub 1$\mu$m

### Thermal [[em-waves]]
- Wavelengths are associated with temperatures
- Wave generation strength(?) is proportional to the temperature of the object
	- How do you characterize 'strength' of generation?
- The higher the frequency, the higher the temperature in Kelvin
- EM waves are emitted by objects in space, and are incident on Earth

### Radio Astronomy
- Discovered accidentally in 1932
- Janksy's detection of Galactic Radio Waves
	- Milky Way
	- Peak Signal
	- 10m parabolic reflector: Grote Weber
	- Reber assumed higher frequencies like 330Mhz would produce stronger signals than at the 20Mhz he'd previously used
		- Unresolved disks of constant [[brightness-temperature]]
		- Crystal detector coupled to an audio amplifier -- unsuccessful
		- 910MHz, still nothing
		- At 160MHz and tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver, detected the Milky Way despite RFI from automobiles
			- Published in 1944 as 'Cosmic Static'
### 21cm Hydrogen line (1951)
- EM spectral radiation line created by a change in the energy state of neutral hydrogen atoms
- Microwaves of the hydrogen line come from the atomic transition between two hyperfine levels of H at *1s* ground state
	- Hyperfine: shifts in energy between the state of the nucleus and the state of the atomic cloud
### Digital Correlators
- First RADC had 21 lgs, 300kHz [[clock-cycle]]

### Interesting topics in radio astronomy
- Microwave Cosmic Background
	-	"A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Megacycles per Second" A. Penzias, R. Wilson, Astrophysical Journal Letters, 1965
	-	Pigeon poop
	-	Bell Labs
	-	2006 Nobel in Physics: Mather and Smoot - 31, 53 nd90GHz radiometers on COBE spacecraft
		-	Subtraction of 2.275K mean reveals the mK diple from motion of our galaxy
		-	Subtraction of the dipole moment shows the radiation of our local galaxy
		-	Subtraction of both the dipole moment and galactic emission shows 100$\mu K$ deviations from the early universe
	-	Detailed observations of the cosmic background have led to the revised concpets of the age and composition of the universe
		-	Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) launched June 2001, and makes [[measurement|measurement]] fundamental to the new standard model of cosmology
		-	The Standard Model of Cosmology assumes the universe was created by the 'Big Bang' and is composed of 5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, and 68% dark energy
- Pulsars
	- Nanosecond radio bursts from strong plasma turbulence (2003) in a supernova (6000 years ago) was how we discoverd the Crab nebula pulsar (1968)
	- Electron content of 0.03$cm^-3$ and dispersion order or 1ms between 8 and 9GHz
- Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)
	- Attempts to answer the question of when humanity whill communicate with extraterrestrial life
	- Kepler spacecraft mission
	- Wow! Signal
	- SKA size arrat could increas listening capacity by 350
### Some aspects of radio astronomy
- Radio telescopes
	- Parabolic reflectors
	- Principles and examples of large reflectors
		- Data rate in bits per second decreases rapidly as astronomical distance increases, so you need big rrays to effectively listen and catch everything there is to hear
	- Arrays of reflectors
		- VLA
		- ALMA
		- SKA
	- [[low-noise-amplifiers]] (LNAs) for Phased Array Feeds
	-
