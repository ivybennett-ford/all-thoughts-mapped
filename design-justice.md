# Design [[values]]: hard-coding liberation?
#### SCC addresses landmark texts on design
In [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=the+design+of+everyday+things) by Don Norman
- [[power-markers]] reveal an insensitivity to axes of inequality.
- The word 'women' is only used once, and as in refernce to images of naked women on the ceiling of the Amphitheatre Louis Laird at the Sorbonne
- Race is never discussed
- An terms related to LGBTQIA+ are not discussed
- Disability is broached as a topic, although the author used the word 'h\*ndic\*pped' instead of diasabled
- Norman fails to be specific, and in doing so, reveals that the user he had in mind while writing the text was largely universal, and that the universal user was white, able, and cisheteronormative.
#### SCC on [[affordance]] perceptibility
The [[design|designer]] should ask these questions during the deisng process:
- How perceptible is the intended use of the design?
- Who ultimately is able to benefit from the design's purpose? 
- How available is the design and to whom?
#### SCC on [[machine-learning|ML]] for [[fairness|fairness]]
- "...[A]lgorithm developers...use [ML] techniques to produce risk constructs that don't have clearly identified real-world variables but are actually stand-ins for race, class, gender, disability, and other axes of oppression." (Costanza-Chock 44)
- "The erasure of history and the failure to consider intersectional structural inequality underpins the pretense of 'fairness' in such decision-making support systems, even as they work to reproduce the matrix of domination"


# Design Practice: "Nothing About Us without Us"

SCC writes about DEI initiatives in businesses, and how without meaningful change at the leadership level, they might as well be useless. She charges that [[designers-should-look-like-America]], and that for all the attempts to bring variance to the product space, design will continue to serve [[cisheteropatriarchy]], [[colonialism|settler-colonialism]], and [[white-supremacy]]. This invites the empathetic approach suggested by Ximena Vila Ferral in her talk on [[what-is-wrong-with-designers]]. It is *because and not in spite of* our backgrounds that we must consider a [[design-methodology]] that is sensitive to white supremacy, cishetpatriarchy, "abelism," instead of one that pretends that the status quo is anywhere good enough.

I am reminded of [[princess-weeks-on-progressivism-and-intent]]: she says that it is not enough that an organization wants to tell progressive [[story-telling|stories]] with DEI initiaitives. As Weekes says, "\[leadership] must also understand what \[they] are trying to subvert: the history of representation"

You also need to understand what you're trying to subvert: the history of representational pain on the screen that you are trying not to repeat.
