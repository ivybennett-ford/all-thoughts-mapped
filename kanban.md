the kanban method was developed by business majors and takes the knowledge management of a sticky note and applies it to a calendar. you can track your work, and bring projects to fruition. 

I am currently implenting the kanban method in my [[Create-Schedule Kanban]] board, where my ideas for projects, and ongoing work is being tracked.

Not sure if I am using it correctly!
