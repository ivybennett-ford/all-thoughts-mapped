# Working Group ATL Summit Debrief survey

During the ATL summit, we met after lunch to discuss impressions from chapters in *What the Eyes Don't See*. We wrote on a collaborative whiteboard in Miro for 5 minutes, voted on sticky notes, and then discussed the notes ranked highest. The following questions will guide future sessions, hopefully to make them as accessible, safe, and generative as possible.

- How satisfied were you with the mode of delivery (collaborative board, voting, group discussion)?

- What would you adjust about the session?

- We discussed some frustrating topics -- discriminate treatment and impact, the breakdown of democracy, an attempted public health cover-up. The work we do going forward will reference stressful topics like that again. How comfortable did you feel talking about the impact of those issues in a group setting?

- How can the facilitator address your needs so that discomfort does not inhibit your participation?
- How important is anonymity to you in a group conversation?

- What do you hope to get out of working group sessions?

- For the next working group session, we can:
	- Read an academic paper
	- Discuss chapters from WTEDS
	- Break the hour up between a paper and the book (30 mins per each)
	Please indicate your preference
