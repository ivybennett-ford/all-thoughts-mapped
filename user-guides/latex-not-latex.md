# Latex not latex
----
latex is a text document formatting tree -- if this is not the case, come fight me

According to the [Overleaf Latex in 30 Minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) page, it is a WYSIWYM, where what you see is what you mean. This means that, like markdown, text is formatted per your direct instructions. Phrases are distinguished by specific and concise syntax.

Based on the Tex system, but I won't go into that here. Just know that the file extension for a Latex file is `.tex`.
