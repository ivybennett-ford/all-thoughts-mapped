- Knowledge hoarding is a problem
- I should keep my vault as a github repo
- Reasons not to make stuff, or why we don't publish our work
	- Not an expert, imposter syndrome, fear of being perceived as a fraud
	- Looking dumb
	- Looking for an end-goal instead of enjoying the process
	- Perfectionism
- Learning in public
	- "Work with the garage door up"
		- A lot fo metaphors would work for this topic -- letting folks takea a look under the hood, getting a closer look at how the sauce gets made
		- Externalizing this knowledge helps
	- "Document, don't create"
	- "Show your work"
	- "Make a habit of creating learning exhaust"
- Walking through NvdH's CODE
	- Kanban has a WIP limit
	- Using tages to log status of WIP/importation and processing
		- "Focus on the process, not the results."
		1. Let your curiosity guide your notes
		2. Identify the lightning rods of thought
			- Bottom up 
				- Build a foundation based on commonalities between notes
				- Using the local graph
					- How can I embed the query?
					- How can I embed a live image of the local graph?
			- Top down
				- Start with a source 'idea,' or commonality
				- Basically this is the inductive versus deductive thing
			- Outside in
				- Use outside conversations or sources to guide 'feedback'
				- nvdh uses a nested tag system to flag notes
					- Says this can be a time-consuming task
				- Feeback and discourse consequently guides new research directions
			- Chaos
				- Random notes!!
					- Either from tagged or search
				- Consider leveraging multiple kinds of templates to make note-taking faster
				- The dice roller can randomize across notes - how can I instantiate this in a single line?
		3. Create stuff!
			- nvdh uses a kanban board
				- Assigns a task counter to the boards to avoid pile-up in any of the states
				- Mimir and Marco Paraducci (?)
				- Create a template for creation
				- How to make task icons round instead of square
				- What is Grafana Mimir?
			- Breathing work!
			- Advanced slides plugin
			- Once you've 'finished' work, tie it back in
			- Notes come with *baggage*
				- That baggage slows us doooown, and we might not be intersted in maintaining that map of content (MOC)
				- For example, [[design]] is probably a really effective MOC for me, because I consistently add/detract from it, circle back, make new connections, use it in unexpected way. I feel like this makes a lot of sense; the notes don't end up being reductive at all, rather they are expansive/connective.

- Expose your process to mitigate the trap of invisibility
	- [[some-kinds-of-fear-makes-you-invisible]]
- Should I use Readwise?
- What is 'learning exhaust'?
- Forming an accountability group
