- Interfaces between two experiences of [[reality]]. 
	- One reality is experienced by the [[user]], who may or may not have expectations about the consequences of button-interaction
	- The other reality is experienced by the button, an object animated by the will of another.
		- Depending on what the button was designed to do, events will transpire *because* of the button, which is now a diminutive actor in the [[actor-network-theory]] space. 
		- The [[mechanics-of-the-unseen]] (again, the degree to which the subsequent events are unseen depend entirely on how revealed the consequent is to the observer) will take place in a seemingly [[magic|magical]] way.
- An invitation for [[event]]-action.
	- A button is depressed with the expectation of a response, the response invites further interaction, a feedback loop is therefore reinforced by the button interaction.
