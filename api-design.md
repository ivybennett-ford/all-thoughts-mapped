According to [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-api-design), good API [[design|designs]] should be constructed to address three key concerns. The motivation behind the API should be obvious. The hoped-for results should directly inform the design process at every step. Finally, the design plan should reveal how the API will be executed. Red Hat establishes these points as the *why,* the *what,* and the *how.*

Design should be accessible, inclusive, and where necessary, flexible. These attributes reinforce equity in design, and the concept of [[design-justice]]. Design justice can be achieved even at the smallest codeblock.
