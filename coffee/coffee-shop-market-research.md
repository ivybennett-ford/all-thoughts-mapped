Good [[coffee-business-plan]] should include market research. This document represents notes taken from the US Small Business Administration's guide on conducting and using market research.

### SBA Suggestions
- [ ] Gather demographic information
- [ ] Weigh opportunities and limitations surrounding customer-database
- [ ] Address the following questions:
		- [ ] **Demand**: Is there a desire for the product/service?
		- [ ] **Market size**: How many people would be interested in the offering?
		- [ ] **KEI**: What is the income range and employment rate?
		- [ ] **Location**: Where do your customers live, where can business reach?
		- [ ] **Saturation**: How many similar options are available to consumers?
		- [ ] **Pricing**: What do potential customers pay for these alternatives?
- [ ] Identify the market share that will impact profits
		- Presumably this involves things like rent/property value, supply, employment trends
- [ ] Gain insight from research into customer reaction to business-specific objects - logos, supply, service, hours, etc.
- [ ] Consider appealing to the [resource partner network](https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find)
	- [ ] Here's a list of suggested [[coffee-resource-partners]] to reach out to first

### Economic trends
- How many coffee shops are there within a four mile radius of the house? Are they drive-thru, walk-up? 
- Roughly how many people live in this circle, and is that number projected to increase by very much in the coming five years? By how much has it grown in the last year?

### Consumer behavior
- When do people buy their coffee?
- What kind of products do they buy?
- Does buying a drink happen at the same time as buying food?
- Does buying a drink happen at the same time as buying whole beans?
	- Will whole beans be an offering?
