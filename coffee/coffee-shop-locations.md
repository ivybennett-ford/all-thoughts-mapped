# Renting or buying a property
---
1. Identify locations
	- Concerns about drive through -- what if we just built a structure on a parking lot? 
	- Consider renting and building own store
	- Consider renting preexisting location
2. Prepare a letter of intent
	- What the business will be used for, and for how long, what you expect to pay in rent
3. Provide a proposal copy tailored to each seller or renting agent
	- If buying a lot and building own structure, or performing serious renovations to existing structure, need to provide a detailed walk-through of what we expect to have done
		- Possibly could help to provide this with a contractor's estimate
	- This should include plans for traffic (customers, deliveries, and employee access) as well as projected profits
