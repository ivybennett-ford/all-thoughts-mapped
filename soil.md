Literally, a combination of organic matter, gas, water, living organisms, and minerals. It has size, [[form]], and history.

In a [[digital-garden]], soil is a place to sort, store and ferment research. Ideas might decay and be absorbed into the general [[knowledge]] framework. But the garden bed is a place for growing things. It is used for planting [[seeds]].

Over [[time]], soil contributes to the 'becomming' of growing things. Soil might be tossed around, and structures erased in tumultuous events.
