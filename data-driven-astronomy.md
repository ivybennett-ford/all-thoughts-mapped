# Data-driven Astronomy with Tara Murphy, University of Sydney
This is a course in [[astronomy]] with a focus on [[computational-astrophysics]]

Learning schedule

### Week 1 Learning Objectives

---

-   Describe what pulsars are and what causes [[radio]] emission from pulsars
-   Write code to implement a mean and median stacking algorithm
-   Compare possible ways of improving these algorithms
