Dear All,

Hopefully, you have received your copies of *What the Eyes Don't See* by Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and *Design Justice* by Sasha Costanza-Chock. We will be incorporating these resources into our [BlueConduit Working Group](https://github.com/BlueConduit/working-group) curriculum.

Our work, supporting access to a lead-free future, is best informed by voices from communities with whom we co-create. It is the goal of the BC Working Group to enrich our unstanding of technology that is designed to meaningfully resist structural inequality.

During the May 9 session, we will be discussing the Prologue through Chapter 3: The Valedictorian of *What the Eyes Don't See*.
