Literally, a [[folgezettle]] is a follow-up note. So in the context of [[breadcrumbs]], [[notes]] are created which are "children" of parent [[note]] [[nodes-antinodes|node]]. 

This is often thought of as a [[tree]] [[data-structures|data-structure]], where folgezettles are branches.

A folgezettle should maintain the principles of [[atomicity]] and [[connectivity]].
