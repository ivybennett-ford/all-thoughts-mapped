a geographic space

you are either on land

or not

you are off the map

or on it



Land exists without the aid of a map. Land is space made fermament. It is critical to wellbeing, critical to inter-intra-action. Without land, there is only the void. 

Even the seas could not be without the land. It's true, we only float, only float on the surface. But we could not *be* without the land.

Humanity definitely seems to struggle with our history of forcibly removing one group of people from the land, pushing them to a different, far-removed place, and installing new people. You could say that the land was taken away, but this is not accurate. The land is contiguous; though it changes, it never ends. So one person or group of persons cannot reasonably claim to own or control land. Therefore, to remove indigenous peoples is both wrong, and a real question of which [[time|time-scale]] you use to examine the issue. 

Maybe humans, deep down, always want to control the land they sit on. Maybe that happens regardless of who you are. And maybe there are other ways of knowing unavailable to the approved channels of [[knowledge]]-gathering. By this I mean that there are likely other ways to conceive of a relationship with the ground under your feet that are simply not learned by people operating within the framework of white-supremacy.
