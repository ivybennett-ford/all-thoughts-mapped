#### Notes
- Freeman critiques the traditional SCOTUS position that 'bad actors' perpetrate injustice in a vaccuum. Articulated that malfeasance could not occur outside the context of societal admission.

>"Of course, not all work in this area reduces discrimination entirely to some set of 'blameworthy' humans behind the machine. Many decisions make clear that algorithmic discrimination can happen in ways that are unintentional or difficult to account for, for example when upstream social [[bias|biases]] are reflected in training data in ways that may be difficult to predict." (p6)
