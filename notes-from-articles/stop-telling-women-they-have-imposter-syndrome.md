 "The answer to fixing imposeter syndrome is not to fix individuals, but to create an environment that fosters a number of different leadership styles and where diversity of racial, ethnic, and gender identities is viewed as just as professional as the current model."

#### The origins of imposter syndrome
- The phrase 'imposter phenomenon' was developed by Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanna Imes in a 1978 study.
- Identifying the symptoms of imposter syndrome in the individual puts blame on them, as opposed to targeting the larger systems at work
- "Imposter syndrome directs our view towards fixing women at work instead of fixing the places where women work"
	- An aside: if the authors intended to enfranchise people who live beyond a gender binary, would they have said so already? It's the Harvard Business Review, so not sure how inclusive they're trying to be. -> Just found it further down.
- Love this note: "'imposter' brings a tinge of criminal fraudulence to the feeling of simply being unsure or anxious," a feeling which will impact each and every aspect of a person's work going forward. Even as we try to articulate feeling insecure or shut-out from engaging with our work, we are told that our affliction is the same feeling an imposter. It all sounds very maudlin.
#### On the origins of [[bias]], and how to proceed
- An aside: where does the term 'heteronormative' come from? Even as it distinguishes the group who is not heterosexual, it sounds like it reinforces heterosexuality as the 'normal,' all else as unusual.
- The problem does not begin with individual, it stems from the impact of white cismale heteronormativity on a cohesive workplace.
- Although the authors have not addresses capital thus far, here would be a good time to interject that [[neoliberal-efficiency-model]]s are designed with the white person in mind -- more often than not a white male. The authors make this stark pronouncement:
>"In truth, we don't belong because we were never supposed to belong."
- Because the efficiency models were designed with white men in mind, with "narrow definitions of acceptable behavior," we should be doing whatever we can to divest from them. 
	- Retro-fitting a poorly designed system will not solve the problem. 
	- Workplaces operating under and for capital are exclusionary by [[design]].
	- The concept of 'imposter syndrome,' by design is a means of gaslighting legitimate complaints by misrepresented and underserved people.
