From the Othering & Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, [The Structural Racism Remedies Repository](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/structural-racism-remedies-repository#healthcare--public--health--and--environmental--justice-raceconscious-public--health--and--environmental--justice):

From Healthcare, Public Health and Environmental Justice:
		
- Expand enforcement of environmental protections and invest in solutions to environmental threats, particularly focusing on communities of color and working families who face disproportionate health effects from pollution, tainted water, and inadequate infrastructure. (DP)

- Require the EPA to consider environmental justice in all its regulatory decisions. (DP)

- Coordinate efforts among EPA, HUD, and CDC to address lead-based paint in aging housing stock. Increase investments  in a Lead Paint Mitigation Fund to ensure all communities have the resources required to address this health threat. (DP)

- Create a 21st-century public health data system that expands on existing environmental health tracking networks66 to provide an early warning system, down to the neighborhood level, of health threats–from the effects of climate change and other environmental changes to clusters of chronic and infectious disease. (DP)

- Make Black people powerful in our communities by acting on the climate crisis as a national priority before more of our communities are hit first and worst by disasters (Black To The Future Action Fund, B2F):
		- Mitigate the climate crisis and reduce pollution

- Environmental justice (EJ) research should make a more concerted effort to take history into consideration and move beyond the question of who lives beside what facilities to tackle the more difficult question of understanding what forces compel people to live beside such facilities. (Toxic Communities: Environmental Racism, Industrial Polution, and Residential Mobility, Taylor, TTC)

- EJ research has to pay more attention to the relative danger of facilities, the ownership structure of hazardous facilities, and the different impact that different types of facilities have on health, property values, jobs, host-community compensation, and so on. (TTC)

- EJ research should focus more on small facilities such as dry cleaners, gas stations, and garages that have impacts on nearby residents and to industrial sectors, such as agriculture. (TTC)

- EJ research should pay more attention to research conducted by the real estate industry and urban planning research. (TTC)

- EJ research should become more theoretically focused, and studies should have explicit theoretical frames that are tested. (TTC)

- EJ scholarship should adopt multimethod approaches that combine, for example, spatial, historical, economic, sociological, and planning techniques. (TTC)

- The organized environmental movement in the United States should broaden its base to include people-of-color, low-income, and working-class individuals and issues. (Dumping in Dixie, Bullard, BDID)

- Organize neighborhoods (BDID):
		- Link people-of-color, working-class, and middle-class environmental activists on issues that cut across geographic boundaries and political jurisdictions. (BDID)
		- Create environmental organizing channels that cut across the political spectrum. (BDID)
		- Develop leader-exchange programs designed to break down the legacy of mistrust and artificial barriers that separate people and hinder mobilization. (BDID)
		- Design training and leadership development programs for emergent grassroots environmental justice groups. (BDID)
		- Institute “adopt-a-community” programs at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and minority institutions around environmental justice and resource-allocation areas-- targeting communities of color threatened by environmental hazards. (BDID)
		- Develop new interorganizational linkages that cut across racial and class boundaries. (BDID)

- Enhance communication across environmental networks (BDID):
	- Disseminate information  that  highlights  the  community's strength  and  power  (potential)  base;  people-of-color  groups should not be timid or shy when it comes to the use of their power. (BDID)
	- Expose the impact of NIMBY by having policymakers deal with this phenomenon not as an exaggerated or irrational fear. (BDID)
	- Instill self-confidence in community leaders and residents.
	- Communicate environmentalism as a universal justice and equity issue. (BDID)
	- Get environmental organizations to accept social justice and urban  industrial  issues  as  legitimate  environmental-agenda items. (BDID)
	- Dispel prevailing myths and stereotypes on both sides (environmentalists and social justice activists) with interorganiza- tional communication. (BDID)

- The climate planning process should involve strong input from vulnerable communities. (PRRAC3)

- Concrete equity metrics should be established that shape the development of a plan and track how equity is being integrated into the implementation of a plan. (PRRAC3)

- Equity goals should be used to inform specific action proposals. (Poverty & Race Research Action Council, PRRAC3)

- Improve communication and coordination between HUD and EPA in order for each of these agencies to know when subsidized housing residents are living in contaminated areas and take concrete [[measurement|measures]] to respond. (MH)

- Improve HUD implementation of its siting standards, reviews, and oversight. [Fair Housing and Environmental Justice, MH](https://www.prrac.org/fair-housing-and-environmental-justice-new-strategies-and-challenges-megan-haberle-journal-of-affordable-housing-february-2017/)

- Build infrastructure that increases health, livability, mobility, opportunity, and resilience for vulnerable communities. [PLAIC](https://allincities.org/toolkit)



The above points are taken verbatim from a comprehensive list of action items compiled by several dozen resources into one document on the effects of [[structural-racism]] and how to combat its ills.

According to the Othering & Belonging Institute, the principles of fairness and planetary awareness and justice exist in a composite state-space. Community members most at risk to be treated without fairness or justice are therefore *othered*, and when fairness and justice are rightfully brought to bear, a sense of *belonging* is achieved.

The organization has existed since 2012, first by the Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society.

The above points have been collected here because it is the belief of this author that they can be immediately incorporated into the practice verifying ethical data science standards.
