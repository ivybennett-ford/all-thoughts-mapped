# [Why you should not bring your authentic self to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRi-jpzBiGo)
by Jodi-Ann Burey

### A Costume Contest
Burey begins her talk with a metaphor -- a [[Halloween]] costume contest. A lie, or a miscommunication. Feelings of betrayal, discomfort, anxiety. This construction feels very well-suited to the conversation, but I want to examine the 'contest' aspect further.

In her story, Burey's protagonist does not receive any votes, because they did not put on a costume like all the other party-goers. Juxtaposing systemic racism in the workplace with a contest is a genius narrative. The individuals who reinforce systems of inequality likely feel their actions are beyond reproach, because they occupy well-placed positions within the [[matrix-of-domination]]. Individuals who suffer from this [[power|power]] imbalance -- Black women, trans\* people, Latinx people, for example -- will only 'win' the contest by putting on a mask, their authentic selves compromised.

### Broken by design

[[capitalism]] does not lend itself to authenticity. It is neessary to be compensated for [[work]], for [[labor]] under Capitalism. Compensation will, in theory, allow individuals to meet their needs, although this is not always the case. Capitalism does not [[affordance|afford]] fair compensation for authenticity.
