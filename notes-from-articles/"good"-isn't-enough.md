Computer scientists claim to [[design]] for "social good," but fail to ideate the political or long-term concrete effects of technological solutionism. Ascribing a moral valuation like "good," or "bad," without committing to serious 'non-reformist reform' means [[equity]] falls by the way-side. Ultimately, solutionism without deep work only serves [[neoliberalism]].

Recommends developing an interdisciplinary foundation for algorithmic interventions (should an algorithmic intervention be deemed acceptable). The author posits that prioritizing technical scores of efficiency like [[accuracy]] should be considered as second to other interventions.
