Geography impacts critique. The [[space]] between [[place|places]] impacts the kind of [[knowledge]] gathering that can occur. However, this geographic element is used as a shield by white supremacist heteropatriarchic scholars in the Western academy.

Mohanty grounds this article in a geographic framework. Historically, regional [[power|powers]] in the northern hemisphere have exploited -- through colonisation, through empire, through hegemony, religion and ideology -- regional powers in the southern hemisphere. When we talk about 'the West,' we are talking about the centuries of white supremacy which have treated some cultures and civilizations as sources of [[primitive-accumulation]].

>"...I want to argue that \[the brusque dismissal of systemic analysis of institutional processes] converges with the proliferation of depoliticized multiplicities...is a hallmark of neoliberal intellectual landscapes." (Mohanty 967-8)

Here, Mohanty explains that neoliberal scholarship is dismissive of Global South histories and contexts. They further explain that addressing systemic conflict does not negate modernist critique. 



The American tendency to separate themselves temporally from contention is a huge obstacle in transnational discourse.
