kanban-plugin: basic

---

## to-start

- [ ] decision: should this be a maintained database (with storage) or stored as a static textfile
- [ ] scrape goodreads
- [ ] decision: is this a flexible app? is this a website? is this a dataframe in a repo?
- [ ] themes and fonts? if this is an actual **thing** then it should look nice-ish
- [ ] example scraper with [[weird-shorts]]
- [ ] tie back to [[story-telling]] and the importance of collecting [[fables]]
