# [[design|design]]
Design happens when a plan is made. That plan is subject to the constraints of the designer's inner life. 
## Themes, challenges, and guiding questions
- Who is your [[user]]?
- How does your creation fill a need?
	- [[capital-interferes-with-need-fulfillment]]
	- [[personhood]] is decided by [[power]] brokers
- What new needs are created by the original solution?
	- To whom do those needs belong?
	- Who is resonsible for filling them?
- What do the privileges of the imagined user reflect about the expected use-cases of the product?
- What does this tell us about the problem-solution framework?
