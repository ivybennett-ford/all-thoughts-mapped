**Definition**: The framework or outline of a plan, system, or object. Aspects of same.

There are many ways to approach design. The goal of accessible, [[antiracist]] design should be to counteract the burdens of [[cisheteropatriarchy]], [[capitalism]], [[abelism]], [[white-supremacy]] and [[settler-colonialism]] as manifested along axes of [[power]] within the [[matrix-of-domination]].

Design can exist without being closely linked to 'good,' or morally correct intention. Design can be conducted intentionally, or unintentionally, and injustice can be perpetuated in the same way. The manifestation of justice (or lack thereof) strongly depends on the actor's placement within the matrix of domination. In short, power is directly proportional to access. Before beginning a design project, it is helpful for the [[actor]] to have identified a [[design-methodology]]. A project can begin once the would-be designer has interrogated their inner life.

Some frameworks are more easily adapted to justice-aligned design than others. One framework which is ultimately pretty neutral is [[value-centered-design]]. In this context, the designer basically has access to a repository of all available [[knowledge]] on the relevant topic, and constructs whatever build-product they were trying to make within the context of their own values and beliefs.

This framework falls apart once the designer realizes that creation is not neutral. The designer must acknowledge their perspective and influence on their own design journey, and consequently, the larger impact the designed thing will have on an ecosystem. This is the narrative in [[design-justice]]. A lot more can be said about this book and the topics discussed within it, so I will save that for the book itself.

There are ways to determine how successful a design really is. In America, [[power-markers]] would maintain that universalism is a core aspect of the relationship between an individual and the wider community.
