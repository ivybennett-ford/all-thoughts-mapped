HA calles the Flint Water Crisis the most impactful public health disaster in American history, "the story of a government poisoning its own citizens and then lying about it." (13) She writes that when Lee Anne Walters was told her PVC pipes must be the source of her lead in her water, when Miguel Del Toral's reportage went unacknowledged, when MDEQ was found to be using faulty (specious) testing procedures, the government of Michigan had failed the people of Flint "\[in] a bizarre disavowal of honesty, transparency, good government, and respect fo scientific truth." (13)

- What thoughts came to mind as you were reading the passages about Del Toral's memo?
- HA makes it clear early on that Flint leadership had disavowed themselves of the historical implications of underserving the community, and in doing so, reaped tragic consequences. She writes that, "\[t]he real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism."(14)

- Knowing this, how can governments regain community trust?
- According to HA, half of African American citizens living in Michigan were without representation by an elected official, under the mangagement of governor-appointed emergency managers (EMs).

- What do you think the public health implications are for disenfranchised communities?

- Notes on Chapter 7: Miasma

- Michigan government demonstrated repeated, consisitent and inconsiderate care for the citizens of Flint.

- "This wasn't the kind of issue where you can shrug and pass the buck. We were literally talking about the systemic poisoning of our children." (p. 92)

- Marc Edwards' testing procedures had uncovered some alarming news: "One sample, collected *after* forty-five seconds of flushing, exceeded 100 ppb -- sixty-five times the federal action level of 15 ppb. The numbers were frightening." (p. 92)

- The treatment of citizens in Flint was consistent with under-represented folks across the entire country. This conflation contributes to a larger picture: public utility, and by consequent, public health, are inextricably dependent on government conduct.

- Elin Betanzo's experience in D.C. was by no means a promising indicator that things would look up any time soon. "Based on her experience in D.C., she felt things would get much worse before they could get better--or drag on for years and never reach a clear resolution;" based on how things have been handled for the last eight years, I would say the second of the two options has been the reality so far (p. 93).

- "In Flint, with an unelected emergency manager in charge, the citizens experienced a similar disconnect and powerlessness. Layers of accountability and responsibility had been stripped away." (p. 93)

- Hanna-Attisha decries a political system like Flint where there was no accountability

- "Politics is about how we treat one another, how we sustain and share our common spaces and our environment." (p 93)

- "When people are excluded from politics, they have no say in the common space, no sharing of ocmmon resources. People may think of this as benign neglect, but it isn't benign. it is malignant -- and intentional." (p. 93)

- Underrepresented communities are often located in close proximity to environmental hazards/stressors which contribute to an overall lower quality of health/acceess to care

- Zoning laws and the dismantling of 1968 Fair Housing codes have made the proximity a largely impassable barrier.

- "The atopic triad of eczema, allergies, and asthma runs in families, is more prevalent in inner cities -- and is worsened by by a variety of environmental conditions." (p.96)

- "If the water was corroding metal engine parts, what was it doing to the ancient lead pipes under the city?" (p. 99)
