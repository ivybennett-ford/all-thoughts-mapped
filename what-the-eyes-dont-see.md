HA calles the Flint Water Crisis the most impactful public health disaster in American history, "the story of a government poisoning its own citizens and then lying about it." (13) She writes that when Lee Anne Walters was told her PVC pipes must be the source of her lead in her water, when Miguel Del Toral's reportage went unacknowledged, when MDEQ was found to be using faulty (specious) testing procedures, the government of Michigan had failed the people of Flint "\[in] a bizarre disavowal of honesty, transparency, good government, and respect fo scientific truth." (13)
- What thoughts came to mind as you were reading the passages about Del Toral's memo?
- 

- HA makes it clear early on that Flint leadership had disavowed themselves of the historical implications of underserving the community, and in doing so, reaped tragic consequences. She writes that, "\[t]he real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism."(14)
	- Knowing this, how can governments regain community trust?

- According to HA, half of African American citizens living in Michigan were without representation by an elected official, under the mangagement of governor-appointed emergency managers (EMs). 
	- What do you think the public health implications are for disenfranchised communities?
