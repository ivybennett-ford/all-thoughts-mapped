alias: linguistic relativity, Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
---

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis explores the extent to which the structure of a person's most-spoken language determines their [[worldview]].

Formerly thought of as linguistic determinism, the theory claiming a person's language not only shaped their world-view, but their ability to *perceive*. This has since been demonstrated to be a misconception.
