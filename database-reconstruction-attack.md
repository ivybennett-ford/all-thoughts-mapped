A database reconstruction attack (DRA) is an aggressive method of reconstructing microdata from a published and public source.

According to the researcher in [[attempt-to-reconstruct-confidential-data-using-public-data]], investigators at University of Texas Austin were able to identify 'known users' from data made public by the Netflix Prize, and public user information from IMDB.

The public dataset from Netflix was the product of a [[collaborative-filtering-algorithm]], and was not meant to contain sensitive information beyond the object (the rating) and an associated key (the entrant's number).
