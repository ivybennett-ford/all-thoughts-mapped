#### Founder's talk
- Reinforce the public aspect of 'public' utility/public health. Utilities are widely owned by the public, and the decision making power about developed tools should be within the purview of the public
- Next directions: I like where our focus is, but it would be great if this could be expanded to enfranchise our community members. Why should our offering stop at the utility sector, if the tools we ultimately build directly affect the lives of folks in our client towns?
- Founders have a vaired revenue stream, to what extend does a financial partnership with 'family funders' create a synergy (or detract from momentum)? To what extent does [[capitalism]] interfere with our public offering?

 #### Professional Development with Ian and Sheela
 - Areas
	 - Confidence ??? (you see what I mean?)
	 - New technology: learning to work with clients/fulfillment
	 - Leadership
 - Goal for 6-12 months from now
	 - Have successfully facillitated a knowledge transfer between external partnerships and the working group to research and development. I want to have identified a client-community-sanctioned product idea and have prototyped it, within a year.
	 - Alternatively, I want to have established a regular forum space between client governments and the communities they serve
 - 3 activities to futher the goal
	 - Extend the working group format to liasing with external partners
	 - Increased frequency or duration of meeting
	 - Have worked directly with a client (as a shadow or first person), to get a sense of the questions they have beyond lead lines. This would be an ongoing activity, which would expose me to:
		 - Working in a client-centered timeline
		 - Working with the Data Team
		 - Enhancing my communication skills through task-oriented dialogue

##### Debrief
- ST: How do we optimize for time between prospect and sale-close?
- \[Fill in notes here]
- SaaS does not easily translate for nontech folks in utility departments. That, and evidently the whole billing process is screwed anyway.
- The differnece between capital and operations expenses
- SaaS implies a specific and personal relationship between us and the people in the budgeting department
- Capital projects are usually upwards of $5k, as one-time purchases
- Cloud expenses are recurring, and get pushed into operations, which are seen as less risky
- The budgeting timeline is dependent on the 'whims' of the budget makers. We should be spending time developing relationships with them, not just the util mgrs
- 'How much money *could* you allocate for operations line items?'
- **Task**: Cold call utils within a 3hr radius of where I live
	- What are the top \[number] capital projects that concern you today?
	- How might data be able to support solutions to those problems?
	- Are you interested in predictive analytics
