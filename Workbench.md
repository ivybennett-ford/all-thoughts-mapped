	- mechanics of the unseen

#### The Wretched of the Earth
- Franz Fanon - *The Wretched of the Earth*, "On Violence"
	- "The colonized, underdeveloped main is today a political creature in the most global sense of the term."(p. 40)
	- "On the other hand, the choice of a socialist regime entirely devoted to the people, based on the principle that man is the most precious asset, will allow us to progress faster in greater harmony, consequently ruling out the possibility of a caricature of society where a privileged few hold the reins of political and economic power without a thought for the nation as a whole." (p. 56)
- Franz Fanon - *The Wretched of the Earth*, "Grandeur and Weakness of Spontaneity"
	- "As long as colonialism remains in a state of anxeity, the national cause advances and becomes the cause of each and everyone...Initiative rests with local areas."
- Franz Fanon - *The Wretched of the Earth*, "Colonial War and Mental Disorders: II. For Nonintellectuals"
	- Referenced in "The birds shall return: Imagining Palestinian futurities" by Tara Alami and Rowan Nabil
	- "...\[E]mphasis is on the body, which is broken in the hope that the national consciousness will disintegrate. Thr individual is 'knocked' into shape. The individual's reward is being spared torture or being allowed to eat." (p. 216)
- Franz Fanon - *The Wretched of the Earth*, "Conclusion"
	- "Let us leave this Europe which never stops talking of man yet massacres him at every one of its street corners, at every corner of the world." (p. 235)
		- "This Europe, which never stopped talking of man, which never stopped proclaiming its sole concern was man, we now know the price of suffering humanity has paid for every one of its spiritual victories." (p. 236)
	- Fanon on the US: "Two centuries ago, a former European colony took it into its head to catch up with Europe. It has been so successful that the United States of America has become a monster where the flaws, sicjness, and inhumanity of Europe have reached frightening proportions." (p. 237)
	
#### Darkly
- Leila Taylor, *Darkly: Black History and America's Gothic Soul*, "Goth-ish"
	- "Southern Gothic"
		- "If the source of the gothic in England is a romanticizing of the past, the Southern Gothic is a deglamorization of the antebellum Dixie...a darker kind of melodrama." (p.45)
- Leila Taylor, *Darkly: Black History and America's Gothic Soul*, "Based on a True Story: Candyman"
	- "The moral of \[Ruth Mae McCoy's] story is, if the Candyman won't get you, poverty, systemic racism, indiffrent law enforcement and underfunded public services will." (p.61)
- Leila Taylor, *Darkly: Black History and America's Gothic Soul*, "American Monster"
	- "Spooky is an ethereal sense that is difficult to place, an unformed and obsured aura of something that is not quite right. The answer to the question, 'where are your people from?' is complicated, and spooky is a complicated word." (p.64)
	- "Dehumanization is a creepy endeavor. While slavery existed in Africa before European intervention, the trade in the Americas required an ideological shift in the pereptions of humanity, an entirely different classification of being deeper than punitive or economic reasoning. We tend to stop at the sheer horror of it and breeze past the elaborate work it took to make the phantasm of race a reality and the illusion that required its upkeep." (p.64-65)
		- "...\[T]he process of dehumanization is a process of monster-making. But monsters have power."
	- "American Monster: Reasonable Dogs"
		- "White supremacy is reliant on Blackness as unknowable, unfathomable, and strange." (p.68)
	- "Black is the Color of my True Love's Hair: The Invention of Blackness"
		- 1767: Linnaeus creates a color-coded taxonomy of humanity
		- " The more specific the list of attributes, the more defined the characteristic, the lesser the humanity. The lesser the humanity, the easier it is to abuse, patrol, ignore, blame, exploit, or kill. But the identity we call 'Blackness' is ephemeral and subject to ever-shifting adjustments of performance...the undefined are more frightening." (p.91-92)
- Graveyard poets
