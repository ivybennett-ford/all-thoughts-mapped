Some kinds of [[fear]] makes you invisible. Fear can bring you into a shadow world. Your name is forgotten, but you crave recognition. You are ambitious and see potential, but you shy from every opportunity. Some might say that a 'healthy' fear of a thing is good, productive. First of all, what does it mean to be healthy? Qualities like health and a limitation must first be interrogated with [[awareness]] of power. Some are healthier than others by simple [[virtue]] of their [[privilege]], and not by an innate aversion to fear or failure. Another way to think about failures and other words that start with 'f' is to acknowledge that the difference between overwhelming paralysis and experience is the [[knowledge|knowledge]] of risk, and the courage to do the thing anyway. Your choice (and all the societal conditioning you've experienced and so on), depends on how close you choose to hold that knowledge.
