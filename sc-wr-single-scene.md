So I definitely do not know how to write a script. But there's something about deconstructing and reconstructing event sequences with a deliberate form/purpose.

There's so much to learn here. Never having studied theatre or plays for the sake of construction, this doesn't feel real. So I want to sit in that unreality.

>Scene 1
>Setting: A small living room in a single-storey apartment. Green gauze curtains are draped over a window stage left. A pale green-gray loveseat covered in shell-pink roses is posed before the window. The Scrim shows a bookcase full of the glittering scurf of a life; a solid block of yellow National Geographic magazines take up a full shelf in the uper righthand corner. Printed pictures are taped up behind the memorabilia, peeking from between books. Where the wall meets the ceiling, twinkling string lights are hung with small white birds. Soft lights. Light and soft sounds from a television facing away from the audience, towards the players.

Where do you draw a distinguishing line between the literary and the overly descriptive? I need to establish place without being too hard to reach. Like if I have a very specific image in my head, then how can I communicate that to a reader? Does the [[reader-matter]] during the early process?
