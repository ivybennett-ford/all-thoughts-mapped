Solids are constructed from atoms assembled into [[lattice]] structures. In the case of [[semiconductors]], physical structures are manipulated at the [[electron]] level with the [[p-n-junction]]. Based on the chemical composition of the solid and the physical position of atoms in the crystal, properties can be leveraged or suppressed to incite specific behavior.
