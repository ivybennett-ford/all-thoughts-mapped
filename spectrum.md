A bidirectional scale used to benchmark [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of [[em]] [[radiation]].

A bidirectional scale that can assume multiple characteristics used to measure the intensity, frequency, likelihood etc of a phenomenon. When navigating #wellness, particularly #mental-health, it is particularly helpful to think about our inner and outer experiences as being part of a spectrum. This ties directly into my personal conception of [[neurodivergence]].
