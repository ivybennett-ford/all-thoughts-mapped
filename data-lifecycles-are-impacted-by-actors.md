[[Design]] should be impacted by many voices. Accessing perspective and experience from many different quarters means design is [[liberated-not-limited]].

This does not mean that the data lifecycle won't be impacted by myriad actors, or that a final design will satisfy the needs or desires of every potential user.

I think the trick to overcoming user fall-off means acknowledging the design's shortcomings, addressing where the breakdown ocurrs in the [[actor-network-theory]], and to interrogate underlying causes.
