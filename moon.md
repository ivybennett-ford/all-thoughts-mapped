In our [[solar-system]], a moon is a natural satellite whose [[orbit]] depends on the masses, origin, and location of the body around which they orbit, relative to the Sun.

[[earth]] has one such satellite, The Moon. It was formed from an asteroid which once smashed into the planet, knocking loose a piece.

Some [[myths]] say that the moon is made of [[cheese]], or that it is an [[egg]] full of [[dragon|dragons]].

Humanity will return to the moon with the [[artemis-mission]].
