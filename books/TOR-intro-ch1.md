[[team-of-rivals]] introduction and chapter 1

Republican candidates for the 1860 presidential electoral season:
	- Lincoln, Illonoise
	- Bates, Missouri
	- Seward, New York
		- the atlas and argus, an albany newspaper
	- Chase, Ohio

So far set up to serve as a multi-biography

"When viewed against the failed efforst of his rivals, it is clear that Lincoln won the nomination because he was the shrewdest and canniest of them all." p. xvi

On the contemporary Republican take on slavery:
	"Though he never officially joined the Republican party, Bates held fast to the cardinal principle of Republicanism: that slavery must be restricred to the states where it already existed, and that it must be prevented from expanding into the territories." p.25
