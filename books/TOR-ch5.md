### "The Turbulent Fifties"
News-gathering was very up-to-the-minute, even for non-readers over the country. 

I wonder how DKG constructed 1850's America in her mind while she wrote this. When cities were referenced, what images and vingettes came to mind? What historic scents and sounds filtered through hours (presumably) spent in libraries?

Enslavement as "written in the bond" according to John Quincy Adams, if never explicitly stated in the Constitution. This feels like a feeble defense.

Henry Clay and the Missouri Compromise both contributed to the contentious road leading up to the Civil War.
	- The Missouri Compromise strengthened the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793
	- The bolsters to the Fugitive Slave Law impeded or restricted outright the person's access to a trial by jury before re/enslavement
In a speech delivered before Congress, Henry Clay claimed that "Northern objections to slavery were based on ideology and sentiment, rather than on Southern concerns with property, social intercourse, habit, safety, and life itself." This is bullish and bigoted on a number of levels. It first presumes a higher moral character of nothern citizens than those of the south. This point could be refuted: northern citizens did not live with daily exposure to the dehumanizing conditions enslaved people were forced to endure, the dehumanizing conditions enslavers chose to prolong. From Friere, (insert ref to [[pedagogy-of-the-oppressed]] here) we understand that the forced Hegelian duality of enslavement does neither party's humanity any good. The disconnection of time and space between the wealthy elites of newly industrialized hubs muffled the grim reality of an enslaved person's life supplying raw goods to be sent up river. Furthermore, Clay's grasp of morality here is based on a post-temperance retreat into religio-political-grandstanding. At best wildly self-centered, and at worst blind to the humanity of the oppressed. Lastly, this point is a week argument for the simple reason that it implies a balance sheet of human-ness that Southern planter-politicians just couldn't hope to match Northerners over. And this is ludicrous. The North benefit from the brutal treatment enslaved peoples received -- they just didn't have to look at it. This ignorance did not make northern politicians any more virtuous than southerners.

Francis Seward recognized this, which is why after hearing Clay's speech, she wrote to her sister and implied she thought Clay was speaking with his head stuck up his ass, in so many words. 

The Kansas-Nebraska Act nullified the Missouri Compromise.
