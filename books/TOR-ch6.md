From 1854 to 1855, many people from European Catholic countries immigrated to America. This led the Know-Nothing party stonewalling pathways to citizenship for new American arrivals. Know-Nothings were divided on the question of enslavement. Ironically, some anti-slavery KNs castigated expanding citizenship for immigrants.

Some saw the hypocrisy in this judgement. Lincoln himself wrote that it was inconceivable that anyone could advocate for anti-slavery and deny citizenship on the other hand. But at the time of his writing that, it seems unlikely that franchisement was on his mind.

During the 1854-55 period, many anti-catholic riots broke out through european receiving stations. Furthermore, this marked the period in time known as [[bleeding-kansas]] where anti-slavery guerillas pushed back against the violence perpetrated by pro-slavery nerds migrating to Kansas under the Nebraska-Kansa Act.

Furthermore, the Dred Scott v. Sanford decision was passed down in 1857. This conversation does not sit well with me: Goodwin's treatment of the 'antislavery North' feels disingenuous to the history of slavery in the North. There were literal plantations in Brooklyn. I'm not sure if she's trying to treat this from a [[zero-point-perspective]]. And that's in line with the popular historiography of 2005. But it does not agree with the long tradition of looking at social problems through the 'bad-actor' lens.
