##### "A History of Black Women and Technology"
"...The shadow obscuring \[a] complex Black women's intellectual tradition is neither accidental or benign." - Patricia Collins, 2009, CKS 23

"Technology is central to the American experiment. Yet technology expertise has been defined and documented in intentionally exclusionary ways. Those in power defined technology and wrote its history, prioritizing the written word and excluding so much of the oral history of Black women who lived through an era of state-sanctioned terrorism and enslavement...the master narrative of American efficiency, progress, and democracy intentionally removed marginalized groups' lives and experiences. Without a written record kept by Black women, we must examine their use of technology between the lines of the historical record." (23-24)

Critical archival studies: the body of historical data traditionally serves the master American narrative. In order to dismantle this incomplete, harmful, and depoliticized picture, archivists treat their work with 'archival amnesty,' where biases and gaps in the narrative are examined more intentionally. CKS illustrates an example of historicized racism and missing components in the narrative. 
	"Lynching, for example, was an all-too-common part of American life, but the counts of the terrorists actions against Black Americans are frequently absent from the archive. Sutherland explains that this erasure does further violence to Black Americans, removing any accountability from the perpetrators and the state that was complicit in these crimes. This erasure harms Black Americans and changes a core part of U.S. history. As Florini writes, 'In U.S. culture, historicizing an event often serves to depoliticize it and works to produce a concensus...\[this facilitates a] contemporary disavowel of its existence.'" (24)

"Excluding Black women from the history of technology furthers the now sedimented idea that white men are most responsible fo technological innovation." (24)
